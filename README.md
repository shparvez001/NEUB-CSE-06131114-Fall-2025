## List of Labs
1. [Lab 1](https://github.com/shparvez001/NEUB-CSE-06131114-Fall-2025/blob/main/lab-01.md).
    1. Write a program which will print your name in one line and your id in another line.
    2. Printing a right triangle pattern using star.
    3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, obtains the two numbers from the user and prints the sum, product, difference and quotient of the two numbers.
    4. Write a program that takes a lower-case letter from the user and convert it into an upper-case letter. 
2. [Lab 2](https://github.com/shparvez001/NEUB-CSE-06131114-Fall-2025/blob/main/lab-02.md).
    1. Write a program to input 2 numbers and print the one that is higher. 
    2. Write a program to print 100 to 1 with space in between them.
    3. Write a program to add the digits of a number.
    4. Write a program to reverse a number.
    5. Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 100 on the screen. Skip those numbers which are divisible by 3 or 5 but not by both. 
3. [Lab 3](https://github.com/shparvez001/NEUB-CSE-06131114-Fall-2025/blob/main/lab-03.md).    
    1. Write a program that will generate the Fibonacci series of length n.
    2. Write a program to print a 5 Ã— 5 square of *.
    3. Write a program to print a pyramid with n levels where n will be taken as input.
    4. Write a program to print a diamond with n levels where n will be taken as input.
    5. Write a program to print the following pattern:
        ```
        n: 3
        a
        bb
        ccc

        n: 4
        a
        bb
        ccc
        dddd
        ```
4. [Lab 4](https://github.com/shparvez001/NEUB-CSE-06131114-Fall-2025/blob/main/lab-04.md). 
    1. Write a C program that will take 2 numbers as input and print the prime numbers between them. The numbers can be in either order.
    2. Write a C program to take 2 numbers as input and print the HCF and LCM of them. The numbers can be in either order. 
    3. Write a C program takes marks of n subjects and print the GPA. Here n will be taken as input.
    4. Write a program to print the following pattern: 
        ```
        n: 2
         /\ 
        /__\ 

        n: 3
          /\ 
         /  \ 
        /____\

        n: 4
           /\ 
          /  \ 
         /    \ 
        /______\
        ```
5. [Lab 5](https://github.com/shparvez001/NEUB-CSE-06131114-Fall-2025/blob/main/lab-05.md). 
    1. Write a program that will declare a n-element integer array where n should be taken as input. Fill the array with integers taken from the user and show the sum and average of the integers. 
    2. Write a program that will declare a 10-element integer array. The array will be filled up by random integers in the range [0, 100]. Use the library functions `rand()` and `srand()` defined in `stdlib.h` to perform the task. After that, determine the maximum element, minimum element and the average of the numbers.
    3. Write a program that will read the marks of 40 students in an array and determine the frequency of grades. The marks will be in the range [25, 99].
    4. Write a program to sort an array of 20 integers using the **_Bubble Sort_** algorithm.
