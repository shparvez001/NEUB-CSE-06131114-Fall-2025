## Task 1
Write a C program that will take 2 numbers as input and print the prime numbers between them. The numbers can be in either order. 

_Sample Execution_
```
? 50 5 
5   7   11   13   17   19   23   29   31   37   41   43   47 
```

## Task 2
Write a C program to take 2 numbers as input and print the HCF and LCM of them. The numbers can be in either order. 

_Sample Execution_
```
? 50 15 
HCF= 5, LCM= 150 
*****
```

## Task 3
Write a C program takes marks of n subjects and print the GPA. Here n will be taken as input. Consider the mark to grade point below. 
80 −100 →4.00,   75−79 → 3.75,   70−74 →3.50,      
65 −69,3.25,    60−64 → 3.00,      55−59 → 2.75,      
50 −54 →2.50,   45−49 →2.75,    40−44 →2.00,     0−39→0.00  

_Sample Execution_
```
How Many Subjects? 5 
Enter mark for subject 1: 5 
Enter mark for subject 2: 60 
Enter mark for subject 3: 70 
Enter mark for subject 4: 80 
Enter mark for subject 5: 90 
GPA is 2.90
```


## Task 4
Write a program to print the following pattern: 

_Sample Execution_
```
n: 2
