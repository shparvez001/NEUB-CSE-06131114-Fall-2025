# NEUB CSE-06131114 Fall 2025 Lab 9

## Task 1
Write a function `swap(int *x, int *y)` that swaps two integers.
_Sample Execution_
```
Before swap: a = 5, b = 10
After swap: a = 10, b = 5
```


## Task 2
Declare an integer array with 5 elements and use a pointer to print and sum the array elements.
_Sample Execution_
```
arr[0] = 10    arr[1] = 20    arr[2] = 30    arr[3] = 40    arr[4] = 50
Sum = 150
```

## Task 3
Write a program that does the following things
1. Ask user for n (number of integers).
2. Allocate memory dynamically using malloc().
3.	Input and display values using pointers.
4.	Free the memory.


_Sample Execution_
```
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter 5 integers:
2 5 6 7 9
You entered: 2 5 6 7 9
```

## Task 4
Write a program to input a string and copy it into another string manually using pointers. Print both strings.
_Sample Execution_
```
Enter a string: Hello This is a Test
Copied string: Hello This is a Test
```
